The sript run_analysis.R performs the following steps:

##Step 1. Merging train and test data into one file
Files with data to be used are dowloaded and unziped.  
Data from the files is read and new variables to be used are created:
- features from "features.txt". 561 rows and 2 columns  
- subject_train from "subject_train.txt". 7352 rows, 1 column  
- y_train from "y_train.txt". 7352 rows, 1 column  
- X_train from" X_train.txt". 7352 rows, 561 columns  
- data_train created merging subject_train, y_train and X_tain using cbind function. 7352 rows, 563 columns  
- subject_test from "subject_test.txt". 2947 rows, 1 column  
- y_test from "y_test.txt". 2947 rows, 1 column   
- X_test from "X_test.txt". 2947 rows, 561 column  
- data_test created merging subject_test, y_test and Xtes using cbind function. 2947 rows, 563 columns  
- full_data created merging data_train and data_test together using a rbind function. 10299 rows, 563 columns  

##Step 2. Extracting the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
dplyr library and select function was used to select all columns that have subjectID, activityID, or contains words "mean" or "std".
A data_MeanAndSTD was created. 10299 rows, 88 columns

##Step 3. Adding descriptive activity names to the activities in the data set
A variable activity_labels from "activity_labels.txt" was created (6 rows, 2 columns). Column names "activityID", "activityLabel" were assigned.
Data from data_MeanAndSTD and activity_labels was merged by column "activityID" using merged function. 
A data_withActivity was created. 10299 rows, 89 columns
The columns were rearranged so that subjectID goes first, followed by activityID, activityLabel and all measures. Subset with select functions were used.

##Step 4. Labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
gsub function was used to change elements of column titles:
- All start with character t replaced with Time  
- All start with character f replaced with Frequency  
- Acc replaced with Accelerometer  
- angle replaced with Angle  
- BodyBody replaced with Body  
- gravity replaced with Gravity  
- Gyro replaced with Gyroscope  
- Mag replaced with Magnitude  
A data_NewNames was created. 10299 rows, 89 columns

##Step 5. Creating a new data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
activityID column was removed, data_NewNames was groupd by subject and activity, means of each variable for each subject and activity was calculated.
A NewData was created. 180 rows, 88 columns.
"NewData.txt" was created from NewData using write.table function.
